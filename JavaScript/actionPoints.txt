ðŸ”¥ Thatâ€™s the spirit! Okay, letâ€™s raise the bar a little higher. This wonâ€™t just test your string skills â€” itâ€™ll start stretching your thinking towards data structures and algorithms.

ðŸš€ Challenge 3 (Advanced): Super Word Analyzer

Task:
Ask the user to input a paragraph of text (not just one sentence). Then:

âœ… Word count: Count the total number of words.

âœ… Character count: Count total characters (ignore spaces/punctuation).

Most frequent word(s): Find the most common word(s).

Unique words: Count how many unique words are in the text.

Word frequency distribution: Display a list of words and how many times each occurs.

Bonus (optional, but strongly encouraged):

âœ… Normalize input: make everything lowercase and strip punctuation before analyzing.

Sort the word frequency list by frequency (highest to lowest).

Find the longest word and the shortest word.

Handle edge cases:

Empty input

Input with only numbers/symbols

Very large input
